## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

1) Histogram with total number of steps taken per day

```{r echo=TRUE}
activity.data <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data=activity, FUN = sum)

barplot(activity.data$steps, names.arg = activity.data$date, xlab = "Date",
        ylab = "Steps")
```

2) Calculate and report mean and median total number of steps taken per day?

```{r echo=TRUE}
print("Mean total number of steps taken per day:")
mean(activity.data$steps)
print("Median total number of steps taken per day:")
median(activity.data$steps)
```
